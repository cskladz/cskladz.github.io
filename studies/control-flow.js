/*
Controlling the flow is as important to a programmer as it is a plumber.
just as the plumber has a series of tools and devices so too does the programmer have her methods and functions
to be deployed in a manner fitting to accomplish the task.

much like a tap lets water flow or not flow through a pipe so too does our use of conditional statements such as :
If
Else-if
Else
Switch

we can tell our program to run or not to run code.
if statements will execute their contained code the expression or statement inside of it resolves to a true or 'truthy' value.
else if requires an if and will be checked for another true or 'truthy' value inside the proceeding paraenthesis. if the preceeding if statement is not true
else statements will always execute when the if false to pass its truthy test.

switch are unique and useful if you have one varible that may be expressed in a series of different values in which you wwant to execute specific code for.
by including or excluding the break you can do some primitive grouping to infer && and || operations.
