/*
Operators are divided into seperate categories based on how many operands are used and act with several purposes

Assignment operators
they are used to attribute value or attribute a reference to a value in a variable.
var example;  //is the declaration stage
example = 10; // by using the equal sign operator we assign value to the variable

Arithmetic operators
these are your "+", "-", "/", and "*" signs and will always resolve into an expressions. 
the standard PEMDAS rules apply so using paraenthesis can help one ensure arthmetic is done is the desired order

Comparison operators
these will resolve to boolean expressions. we can use "<", ">", "===", "!==".
it will take two expressions and depending on the symbol used, will resolve the two expressions into one Boolean, true, or false.

Logical operators
these include "&&" (and), "||" (or), "!!" (not).

Unary operators (!, typeOf, -)
    act on one value or expression. 
    typeOf will look at one value and return a determination of its type as a string
    ! the 'bang' operator will coerece the opposite boolean value
    - will invert the value of an expression

Ternary operator is also know as the conditional and takes three operands like this if statement:
    (a ? b : c)
    the first is a coerced boolean value indicated by it being left of the ?. 
    the first expression after the ? is returned value if true.
    and the last expression is the returned value if false.
    
    All of these operands are used to control the flow of meaning in and through our variables throughout our code.
